# microcystin-VAreservoirs2023
Code to compare and visualize microcystin levels in several Virginia reservoirs.  Includes box whisker and scatter plots to highlight monthly variations and compare littoral versus lacustrine concentrations. I prepared this at the request of Dr. Paul Bukaveckas at VCU.
